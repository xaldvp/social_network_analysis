# Social Network Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing graph networks. It aims to uncover insights about relationships, influence, and community structures within a given dataset. The project leverages Python and popular libraries such as NetworkX, Pandas, and Matplotlib, making it versatile for both academic and practical applications.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Create graphs from raw data.
- **Centrality Analysis**: Identify key nodes based on metrics like degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.
- **Community Detection**: Uncover clusters and subgroups using modularity-based methods.
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive and static visualizations for better data comprehension.
- **Reports**: Automatically generate reports summarizing network statistics and findings.
